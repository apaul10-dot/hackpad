# Wednesday June 4

I started working on my hackpad after days of procrastenation. I joined the call hosted by Alex which thought me many things about building a hackoad and I took a significant amount of insipration from it. This also gave me 1 extra point setting me at 2 points.

# Friday June 13 

I completed my schematic for the hackpad but had to take a break due to exams coming up in the future

# Saturday June 21

I completed my pcb after conferring with fellow hack club members about it as I found it a challenge. I felt very proud odf htis moment as I am a begginer to hardware projects

# Saturday June 28

I completed my CAD and fimrware which took some time as I had never built a hackpad before. This being my first ever hardware project I was ery happy to complete it and hope to recieve the full four points for highway.
